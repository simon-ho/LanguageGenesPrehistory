# Language, Genes, and Prehistory

Linguistics and genetics have traditionally pursued different approaches to the reconstruction of human prehistories, applying different methods and often working at different time-scales (Blench, Ross and Sanchez-Mazas 2008). In recent years, however, research has emerged which attempts a direct correlation of linguistic and genetic indicators of population migrations (Poloni, Sanchez-Mazas et al 2008; van Driem 2014), and a rapidly growing field of inquiry applies methods developed in the context of computational phylogenetics and cladistics to various types of language data to derive probabilistic models of language evolution and, therefore, language relationships (Gray and Atkinson 2003; Dunn, Burenhult et al 2011; Zhang, Shi et al 2019, among many others).

This day-long interdisciplinary workshop will bring together world-leading scholars from the University of Sydney, Australian National University, and University of Berne to focus on intersections between theory and method in evolutionary biology and linguistics, with a special focus on the Asia-Pacific region. A two-hour software clinic will also be convened (please bring your own laptop). Students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged.
